# MUGicalNode

An implementation of my [MUGicalPHP calendar generation script](https://github.com/web-goddess/MUGicalPHP) that runs as a collection of AWS Lambda serverless functions.

If you'd like to subscribe in your calendar application of choice, there are two options:

## Individual Events
These calendars include a separate event for every meetup. Depending on the city, that could involve a lot of events.
* https://krishoward.org/sydneymugs.ics
* https://krishoward.org/melbournemugs.ics
* https://krishoward.org/brisbanemugs.ics
* https://krishoward.org/perthmugs.ics
* https://krishoward.org/hobartmugs.ics

## Digests
These calendars have a single all-day event for each day that includes all of the meetups as a list within the description. For full details on a meetup, you'll have to click on the provided URL.

## General
### Installation
The basis for this app came from Open Austin's [meetup-proxy-aws-lambda](https://github.com/open-austin/meetup-proxy-aws-lambda). I've broken it up into three separate lambda functions, each of which lives in its own directory within `src`:

* `src\getgroups`
* `src\getevents`
* `src\makecalendar`

After you clone the repo, you'll need to install some stuff:

```
npm install
npm install aws-sdk
npm install request-promise
npm install ical-toolkit
npm install striptags
npm install express
npm install axios
```

### Getting OAuth credentials
As Meetup have deprecated use of simple API keys, we have to jump through a few hoops to get authorised. (I'm indebted to [Soham Kamani's blog post](https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/javascript/2018-06-24-oauth-with-node-js/) for showing how to do this.) Start by going to Meetup and [creating a new OAuth consumer](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/oauth_consumers/). Set the Redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/oauth/redirect`. Once you've created the consumer, you'll have a Key and a Secret.

Go to `auth\index.html` and replace `{key}` with the Key for your Meetup consumer app.

Then go to `auth\index.js` and replace `{key}` with the Key and `{secret}` with the Secret for your Meetup consumer app.

Open a terminal and go to the `auth` directory and run `node index.js`. Then open a browser window and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), where you should see the `index.html` landing page. Click on the ‚ÄúLogin with github‚Äù link, and youll be redirected to the familiar OAuth page to register with Github. Go ahead and authenticate. Afterwards it'll try to redirect you to [http://localhost:8080/oauth/redirect](http://localhost:8080/oauth/redirect) and just hang since that doesn't exist. However, have a look back in your terminal which should have logged four lines.

**requestToken:** {longcrypticstring}  
**accessToken:** {longcrypticstring}  
**expiry:** 3600  
**refreshToken:** {longcrypticstring}

The only one you need\* is the accessToken. Copy them all to be safe, and then you can Control-C to kill the webserver.

\* Yep, I know that's weird. It should expire, right? But so far in my testing it hasn't. Even if I reauthorise and get a new access token, the old one still works. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Implementing a lambda layer to refresh access is the next item on the To Do list, as it's bound to happen eventually.

### Systems Manager
In the AWS console, go to Systems Manager and click on Parameter Store in the menu on the left. Click the button to Create a Parameter. Set the name as `accessToken`, Tier as standard, and Type as Secure String. Paste in your accessToken into the box for Value. You can leave all other fields the same. Click the Create Parameter button to save.

### Testing

If you want to test out one of the lambdas, you'll need to first install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to your machine.

Then update the `tests\index.js` file to point to the lambda you want to test.

Then just run:

```
npm run test
```

### Deployment

If you haven't created the lambdas yet, do that first. You can just use the "Author from scratch" option for each one. The runtime should be `Node.js 8.10`. The name of each lambda needs to match the name of a folder within `src`. I recommend setting the timeout to 3 minutes.

I recommend setting up a new execution role. You'll need to make sure this role has access to CloudWatch Logs, S3, SQS, Systems Manager parameters, and the relevant DynamoDB tables. (See below.)

From the directory on your machine, run this (being sure to substitute in the name of your lambda/folder:

```
./lambda.sh {nameoflambda}
```


## /src/getgroups

This lambda gets all the meetup groups associated with various topics in a given location and sends them to an SQS queue. This runs once per day at 1am.

### Setup
* You need to create an SQS queue called `meetupgroups`.
  * The retention period on the queue is set to 23 hours, which ensures that if something goes wrong, it gets purged before it runs again the next day.
  * The default visibility timeout on the queue is set to 5 minutes.
  * After 3 failed attempts to retrieve events, the group is sent to a dead letter queue.
* You need to set up a CloudWatch rule for each city to trigger the lambda to run on a cron schedule.
  * The target should be set to your lambda function.
  * You should configure the input to pass in a constant (JSON text): `{"targetlocation": "Brisbane"}`

## /src/getevents

This lambda retrieves a group from the queue and then calls the Meetup API to retrieve its upcoming events. These are saved to a DynamoDB database. This runs every minute, all the time. Events will be deleted a day after they finish.

### Setup
* You need to create a DynamoDB table called `meetups`.
  * You should enable the `Time to live attribute` and set the TTL attribute to `deletedate`.
* You need to set up a CloudWatch rule to trigger the lambda to run every minute.
  * The target should be set to your lambda function.

## /src/makecalendar

This lambda retrieves all the events for a given location from the database and turns them into two iCal calendars: one with lots of separate events and a digest that has one all-day event per day. These are uploaded to S3. This runs once per day at 11pm.

### Setup
* You need to create an S3 bucket to write to.
* You need to set up a CloudWatch rule for each city to trigger the lambda to run on a cron schedule.
  * The target should be set to your lambda function.
  * You should configure the input to pass in a constant (JSON text): `{"targetlocation": "Brisbane"}`


## /src/MUGicalNode - DEPRECATED

My first attempt at a direct implementation of the old version. It works, but the MeetupAPI really, _really_ doesn't like me hitting their API so much.
